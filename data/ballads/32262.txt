H : 135291 AND ELEGY On the Death of the Right Honourable HENEAGE LORD FINCH , Baron of Daventry , High Chancellor of England , Earl of Nottingham ; And one of the Lords of the most Honourable Privy-Council ; Who Departed this Life , Decemb. 18. 1682. GReat FINCH is Dead , Oh! tell it not aloud , Left cruel Death insult and grow too proud , Fraught with so rich a Spoil , whose Worth alone Was more than Thousand common Victims own , And by our Loss , alas ! too dearly known . Let Sorrow stalk in silence , and become The greatness of our Grief by being Dumb : Let all our Eyes release their flowing springs , While some sad Bird his Mournful Ditty sings ; Justice her self in sables will appear , As for a Son , the Darling of her Care ; She Weeps and Mourns , and sighing sorely , stands Unmov'd , dejected , and with folded Hands : Where shall be found a Man so good , so great , So Noble , and so every way complete ; When young , untainted with the vice of Youth , A Soul made up of Innocence and Truth . Vice he abhorr'd , but Virtue was his Life , By which he evermore maintain'd the strife With wickedness and since ; nor would submit To be ungodly to be thought a Wit ; But solid Wisdom was his only Rule , ( All else is but pretence to guild a Fool ) Sage Care and prudence in his Face were seen , Sweet , though Majestic , was his portand meen ; His Tongue drop'd Manna , sweetly did he speak , Nor was his Copious Fancy long to seek ; Judgement and Eloquence together join , And with a perfect Harmony combine , To make his sense and Language both Divine , As in some great and Regular Design . But never must we hope to reach thy praise , He that dares highest will deserve the Bays . Nothing thy Merit ever can express , We hope but pardon , since we do confess Our Faults , acknowledgement will make them less . Thou liv'st above the power of Time and Death , Which though it has depriv'd thee of thy Breath , Thy Lasting Name to ages shall endure , Than Rocks of Adamant more firm and sure ; Thy Universal Goodness shall be told Throughout the World , thy Glories be enroll'd In the great Book of Fame , where thou shalt stand And Instance high of Virtues large command : To God thy Duty thou didst early pay , Presenting him the first Fruits of the Day , And over all thy great Concerns didst pray : The Pillar of the Church as well as State , Thou bought'st thy Honours at no easy Rate ; But still wast caring for the Nations Peace , That Arts might grow , and Piety increase , Thy Countries Glory was thy latest wish . Most Loyal to thy Prince , whom thou didst know Was plac'd as Gods Vicegerent here below ; And therefore didst oppose all lawless Rage , That threat'ned so to overflow the Age ; But thou , the Chancellor , with prudent Law Didst keep the Factious Multitude in awe ; Thou every part of Life didst act with skill , And each Relation prudently fulfil : And when thy Work was finish'd quite and done , The alwise God thought fit to call thee Home . The Epitaph HEre lies' the sacred Dust Of FINCH , as Great as Just ; The Glory of His age , Who having left the Stage Of Mortal Life , by Death Has gain'd a better Breath . FINIS . Printed for J.
