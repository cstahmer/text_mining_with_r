COme Bachelors and Married men , and listen to my Song ; And I will show you plainly then , the injury and wrong That constantly I do sustain , by the unhappy life , The which does put me to great pain , by my unquiet wife . Shee never linnes her bawling , her tongue it is so loud , But always shee'le be railing , and will not be controlled : For she the Breeches still will wear , although it breeds my strife , If I were now a Bachelor , I'de never have a Wife . Sometime I go i'the morning , about my daily work . My wife she will be snorting , and in her bed shy'le lurk : Until the Chimes do go at Eight , then she'le begin to wake ; Her morning's draught well spiced straight to clear her eyes she'le take . As soon as she is out of bed , her Lookingglass she takes , So vainly is she daily led , her morning's work she makes In putting on her brave atyre , that fine and costly be , While I work hard in dirt and mire , alack what remedy . Then she goes forth a Gossiping , among her own Comrades . And then she falls a bowsing , with her merry blades : When I come from my labour hard , then shee'le begin to scold , And calls me Rogue without regard , which makes my heart full cold . When I come home into my house , thinking to take my res Then she'le begin me to abuse , before she did but Jes With out you Rascal , you have been abroad to meet your Whore : Then she takes up a Cudgels end , and breaks my head full soar . When I for quietness sake desire , my wife for to be still ; She will not grant what I require , but swears shee'le have her will : Then if I chance to heave my hand ; straight way she'le murder cry : Then judge all men that here do stand , in what a case am I . The second Part , To the same Tune . ANd if a friend by chance me call , to drink a pot of Beer ; Then she'le begin to curse and brall , and fight , and scratch , and tear : And swears unto my work she'le send me straight without delay , Or else with the same Cudgels end , she will me soundly pay . And if I chance to fit at meat , upon some holy day , She is so sullen she will not eat , but vex me ever and aye : She'le pout , and lour , and curse & ban , this is the weary life That I do lead , poor harmless man , with my most dogged wife . Then is not this a piteous cause , Let all men now it try , And give their verdicts by the Laws , between my wife and I , And judge the cause , who is to blame , I'll to their Judgement stand , And be contented with the same , and put thereto my hand . If I abroad go any where , my business for to do , Then will my Wife anon be there , for to increase my woe : Straight way she such a noise will make , with her most wicked tongue , That all her mates her part to take , about me soon will throng . Thus am I now tormented still , with my most cruel Wife , All through her wicked tongue so ill , I am weary of my life : I know not truly what to do , nor how my self to mend ; This lingering life does breed my woe , I would 'twere at and end Oh that some harmless honest man , whom Death did so befriend , To take his Wife from of his hand , his sorrows for to end : Would change with me to rid my care , and take my wife alive , For his Dead wife unto his share , then I would hope to thrive . But so it likely will not be , that is the worst of all , For to increase my daily woe , and for to breed my fallen . My wife is still most froward bent , such is my luckless fate , There is no man will be content , with my unhappy state . Thus to conclude and make and end , of these my Verses rude , I pray all wives for to amend , and with peace to be endued : Take warning all men by the life , that I sustained long , Be careful how you'le choose a Wife , and so I'll end my Song .
