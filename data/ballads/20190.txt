[ Rock the cradle John , or ] Children after the rate of 24 in a year , Thats 2 every month as plain does appear , Let no man at this strange story wonder . It goes to the tune , of Over and Under . TO Here was a country gallant , that wasted had his talent , Not dreading what would fallen out , would needs a wooing ride ; Unto a lass of the city , that courteous was and pretty , This damsel neat and witty ; he would go make his Bride : This lass she had of wealth good store , her stock was threscore pound and more , Though some supposed her to be poor , the same hath late been tried . Rock the Cradle , rock the Cradle , rock the cradle John , Ther's many a man rocks the cradle , when the child's none of his own . Unto this lass , incontinent , the youngman went with good intent , His love was fixed and firmly bent , to take her to his wife : Quoth he my sweet , while life does last , my heart is in thy bosom placed , Let not my suit be now disgraced , I'll love thee as my life : Said she your suit I must deny , for I have vowed a maid to die , If I loose my virginity , it sure will breed much strife . Rock the cradle , etc I have been wooed by Harry , but I indeed will tarry , I do not mean to marry , while I on earth remain : Sweet William and young Thomas too , and Richard hath made much ado , And Ned with tears did often woe , but Humphry did complain , All these brave gallants I forsake , I prithee John no more words make , But to some other course betake , I do thy suit disdain : Go rock the cradle , etc The man no whit dismayed , at that which she had said . But with his sweet heart stayed , and did request her still : He did entreat her favour , it all that he did crave her , That he might only have her , his fancy to fulfil : My heart does fry in Cupids fire , thy beauty I do much admire , Then yield my love to my desire , or else a man you kill : Rock the cradle , etc When she her self did understand , she had a fool caught by the hand , Her ship she knew was soundly maned , her belly wondrous round : Thought she this is a friend of mine , its best make hay while sun does shine , Yet to some thing I will him join , before my fault be found , Said she if I be made thy wife , thou must me humour all thy life , And careful be for fear of strife , like to a prentice bound , Rock the cradle , etc The second part . To the same tune . I N the morning if I thee desire , thou must rise up and make a fire , And other things I shall require , which thou must undertake : My breakfast thou must dress also , that I from bed to it may go , All these hard tasks and many more , thou must not then forsake , To brush my gown and set my band , make clean my shoes at my command , Thy business thou must understand , if I the word but speak . Rock the cradle , etc And when we chance to have a child , thou must like to a father mild , Unto the same be reconciled , and dance it on thy knee : Or if the infant cry for pap , thou then must take it in thy lap , And feed it well what ever hap , if John will marry me : Thou must take pains as thou art able , to make the bed and serve at table , And lay the young one in the cradle , while I sing merrily . Rock the cradle , etc Sweet heart quoth he to please thee , I'll do all things to ease thee , I will not once disease thee , nor yet my love offend thee , My hands under your feet I'll lay , the wind shall not my love annoy , So thou wilt be mine only joy , I'll love thee to the end , I'll make the bed the house isle sweep , and lull thee baby fast asleep , What you command my self will keep , and will my humour bend : Rock the cradle , etc To this they both agreed , and married were with speed , For she had wondrous need , as you shall hear hereafter : The same day month that they were wed thee married man was finely sped , His wife was safely brought to bed , and had both son and daughter , Which by the midwife in was brought , quoth she you have a strange thing wrought Two children in a month begotten , and so took up a laughter , Rock the cradle , rock the cradle , rock the cradle John , Said he the children I will rock , for why they be mine own . He kissed the girl and loved the boy , said he you are your father's Joy , The many are in great annoy , because they have no child : I knew a Lord and Lady fair , that did desire to have and heir , Now I my self have god a pair , and they are both beguiled , My wife is fruitful now I see , and will some great increase bring me , They are your own assuredly , then said the midwife mild , Rock the cradle , etc See here the boy is like the dad , which well may make your heart full glad Cheer up your self and be not sad , for that which here is done : His ruby lips do plain disclose , his cherry cheeks and dads own nose , For twenty pound , I will not loose , quoth he my little son : So well content this fool was found , he leapt for joy above the ground , Old sorrows shall quoth he be drowned , since new are fresh begun : Rock the cradle , Jog the cradle , thus I'll have it known , I love to rock the cradle , the children be mine own . All you which now have herd this ditty , take heed with wives how you do fit you , For if you came to London city , you quickly may be sped As here you see this country Lad , within one Month was made a Dad Though he but little share int had , his wife was brought to bed , And now this simple woodkocke , the cradle is constrained to rock , His neighbours does deride and mock , cause he is so besteaded , They shout and cry , and to him say , still the Children John , This enough to make the man , to think they be none of his own .
