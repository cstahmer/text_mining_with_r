SOme say , the Papists had a Plot , Against the Church and Crown ; But be it so , or be it not , The King must please the Town . The Papists take Tybourn by turns , To please the City-Gulls ; It's strange , that they , who all wear Horns , Should fear the Popish Bull's , II The House of Commons blow the Coals , The Nation to dissettle ; And , like true Tinkers , make two Holes , To mend one in a Kettle : Or else , What needs that precious Vote , That if the King should Fallen By Pagan , or Fanatic Plot , The Pope must pay for all ? III . Our Royal James of Princely Raze , And High Illustrious Fame , Was not thought fit , by Commons base , To follow Charles's Wain : But let that House of Office know , When they have Sow'd their Leaven , He shall Succeed , though they say no , By all the Laws of Heaven . IV. Old Cavaliers for Loyalty They straight Clapped up for Treason , In hope's to bring in Anarchy , 'Gainst Justice , Sense , and Reason . Brave Hallifax and Feversham , Brave Worster , Just and Wise , They did Vote down , as dangerous Men That they Themselves might Rise . V. But Oh! that Lord in Leistershire , Turn'd Catchpole , though too Late ; 'Tis better Priests in Prison were , Then Bums should lose their Trade : For Priest poor Waller never sought , But where was Golden Crosses ; His Mirmidons went Snacks , 'tis Thought , In all the Owners Losses .
