H : 135870 Great YORK and Albany : OR THE Loyal Welcome to His ROYAL HIGHNESS on His Return from SCOTLAND . To the Tune of , Heigh Boys up go We . NOw now the Zealots all must droop , the Synagogues shall down , and Truth and Loyalty get up , The Pillars of the Throne ; The Whigs , ( who Loyalty forsook , ) shall with one Voice agree , To welcome home the Mighty Duke of YORK and ALBANY . [ 2 ] Behold with what a Glorious Train Of Noble Lords and Peers , Great York is Guarded o're the Main , In spite of all our Fears ; Our Groundless Doubts , and Jealousies Of Popish Slavery . For who can keep the Crowd in Peace , But York and Albany ? [ 3 ] The wandering Dove that was sent forth To find some Landing near , When Englands Ark was tossed on Floods Of Jealousy and Fear ; Returns with Olive-branch of Joy , To set the Nation free From Whiggish Rage , that wou'd destroy Great York and Albany . [ 4 ] And now He is return'd in Peace , With all His Pompous Train , Whom Heav'n protected o'r the Seas , To Bless this Land again ; Let Us with Thankful Hearts comply , And Joyful Harmony ; For Scotlands Hope , and Englands Joy , Is York and Albany . [ 5 ] Let Bumpers flow , and Bonfires blaze , And every Steeple Ring , To set forth Royal Jemmy's Praise , The Brother of our King , Let Trumpets found , and Canons roar , All with one voice agree , Since Heav'n again has brought ashore Great York and Albany . [ 6 ] These solemn Rights they freely gave To ev'ry Factious Brother ; Who thought the Nation to Enslave , And Ruin one another : To M ------ and each Factious Lord , To Oh --- and S ------ But thought it Treason to afford To York and Albany . [ 7 ] Now be confounded , all you Tribe Of Ignoramus sway ; Who by Malicious Plots contriv'd To drive the Heir away , ( As you did once before to France ) And Exile o'r the Sea ; Who to your grief did home advance Great York and Albany . [ 8 ] And may he , with the Joys He wed , Together flourish still ; And live to crush the Serpents Head , Whose Sting did pierce his Heel ; Till Rebels tremble at his Name , And all the Land agree , The Just Succession to Proclaim Of York and Albany .
