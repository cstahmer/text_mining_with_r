H : 180167 Londons Joy and Triumph , On the Installment of Sir William Pritchard LORD MAYOR for the Ensuing Year . To the Tune of , Tangier March . I . LEt the Whigs revile , The TORIES Smile , That their business is Completed , Let all Rejoice With Heart and Voice , That the Whig's at last Defeated . The Whigs for Loyalty so Fam'd , With all their hope's are Undone ; Since now brave Pritchard is Proclaim'd The LOYAL Mayor of London . II You Polish Brace Whose Brazen Face , To the Chair wou'd be Aspiring , See the Rabble Crowd Who Poll'd so Loud ; Are bawk'd beyond Admiring ; Learn in time to mitigate Your bold Tumultuous Fury , E're you shall find , you trust too late , To Ignoramus-Jury . III . Let P --- r Tom Receive the Doom , So long due for his Cheating , Who did purloin The CITY Coin , To keep up Holy Meeting ; To Rob the Orphan , and the Poor , His great Discharge of Trust is , And run upon the Widows Score , To do the CITY Justice . IV. Let Ward Repent , And Jenks Relent , Their Practices so malicious , Let Hobland rue With all the Crew , That they were so Officious ; Such Jews as these , who did deny Their Saviour for a Tester , No doubt again wou'd Crucify , Their Sovereign Lord and Master . V. For NORTH and RICH , And every such , They set up a Papillion ; 'Gainst PRITCHARD hold , With Cornish , Gold , With Riot and Rebellion : To love the KING can you pretend , Who Royalists deny all ; And with such Vigour dare contend , Against the Man that's Loyal . VI . For shame in time Repent your Crime , Your Riot and Commotion ; And to the MAYOR , Who kept the Chair , Pay all your just Devotion ; Such was their Loyalty of late , To give the KING no Money : But freely threw away their Plate , To join with Rebel TONEY . VII . Thus you before Did run on score With Royal CHARLES your Master ; Like drunk or mad Spent all you had To uphold a bold Imposture : Let not Knaves again betray , And rob you of your Reason , Then leave your Factious Heads to pay The forfeit of your Treason . VIII . With all your heat What did you get ? With all your din and quarter ; But to involve With each Resolve The more-entangl'd CHARTER ? To CHARLES your just Allegiance give , Your PROPERTIES , then plead 'em : Defending the PREROGATIVE , You best protect your FREEDOM . LONDON : Printed in the year MDCLXXXII .
