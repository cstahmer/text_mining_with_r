H : 135958 A NEW SONG , ON THE Strange and Wondered GROANING BOARD . I . WHat Fate inspired thee with Groans , To fill Fanatic Brains ? What is't thou sadly thus bemoans , In thy Prophetic Strains ? II Art thou the Ghost of William Pryn , Or some Old Politician ? Who long tormented for his since , Laments his sad Condition ? III . Or must we now believe in thee , Th' Old Cheat Transmigration ? And that thou now art come to be A Call to Reformation ? IV. The giddy Vulgar to thee run , Amaz'd with Fear and Wonder ; Some dare affirm , that hear thee groan , Thy Noise is petty Thunder . V. One says and Swears , you do foretell A Change in Church and State ; Another says , you like not well Your Master Stephens Fate . VI . Some say , you Groan much like a Whig , Or rather like a Ranter ; Some say as loud , and full as big As Conventicle Canter . VII . Some say , you do Petition , And think you represent The Woe , and sad Condition Of Old Rump Parliament . VIII . The wisest say , you are a Cheat ; Another Politician Say's , 'tis a Mystery as great And true , as Hatfield Vision . IX . Some say , 'tis a New Evidence , Or Witness of the Plot ; And can Discover many things , Which are the Lord knows what . X. And lest you should the Plot Disgrace , For wanting of a Name , Narrative Board henceforth we'll place In Registers of Fame . London , Printed for T.P. in the Year 1682.
