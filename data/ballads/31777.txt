Englands rejoicing at that happy day That peace and truth it may bear sway , Being th' Election of that thing , In choosing us a Royal King , To the Tune of , Gallant Soldiers do not muse .

About the merry month of May , we hope to see that happy day Wherein they will so well agree that we shall live in unity , Whereby we may rejoice and sing , that happy day we chus'd a King . The Army it does take a part for to join with hand and heart Whereby we may have a head that may stand us in some stead That we may rejoice and sing that happy day we chus'd a King . Apollo's wisdom God them send , And Hercules's strength for to defend That we all may live in peace , and that these bloody wars may cease Then we shall rejoice and sing that happy day we chus'd a King . This many years we've been in woe not knowing well our friend from foe Which brought the land into great strife to kill and slay we were so rife But now we will rejoice and sing that happy day we chus'd a King . Although we have then suffered long we hope now for to change that song That peace and truth may bear the sway God grant us then that happy day That we may rejoice and sing when Charles the second is our King . The second part , to the same Tune . IN former age we were at rest when as the Land was not so seast But lived in love and unity , until became this misery . But now we will rejoice and sing when Charls the second is our King . The sad Excise hath been so rife it hath both begger'd man and wife , But now we hope that it will down , when that Charls obtains the Crown Then we will rejoice and sing that happy day we chus'd a King . Trading it hath lain long dead , and all was for want of a head , Which we hope for to obtain , to live in comfort once again . Then we will rejoice and sing , when Charls the second is our King . That Proclamation it will down that took away Charls Stuarts crown And Charls the second once again does hope the same for to obtain And then we will rejoice and sing when Charls the second is our King . False Prophets they did soon arise , and thought thereby to get a prize , And for to pull the Churches down but they will be taimed soon , And then we shall rejoice and sing when Charls the second is our King . Of New years day they did begin thinking that they all might win , York Minster they locked on the same thinking thereby to honour gain , But aid there came then presently which made them presently to fly . If they will not be rul'd in time they will be punish'd for their crime , When that Charles will bear the sway , their quaking then will soon decay , And then we may rejoice and sing when Charles the second is the King . Then will the Gospel flourish rife , and we shall be no more at strife , Whereby we may give God the praise that such a Comforter did raise , To cause thereby a happy peace , that these bloody wars may cease .
