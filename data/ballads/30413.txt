The Papists Lamentation for the loss of their Agent William Viscount Stafford , together with the dread they are possessed with , fearing that more will quickly follow him the same way . Preparations will be made For those that cursed Plots have laid , For to be brought to Trial fair , And now they'r filled with despair Tune of , Fair Phillis your prevailing charms , or A Fig for France . LAment , lament you Saints of Rome , Since Stafford hath receiv'd his doom , And we poor Souls are left behind Perplexed and troubled in the mind , We see that God did strangely blast , And brought to light your Plot at last . Sure 'tis he hates such horrid things As Massacres , and killing Kings . Let us lament his Rigid Fate , Who for Rome's cause we know of late Did like a stubborn Papist die In hope's to live eternally , But in our Consciences we know It is unlikely to be so , For God does hate such bloody things As Massacres , etc Some others daily we Expect , That took such courses indirect , Must follow him the selfsame way , And on the Block their Heads must lay , But if impartially we speak , The Devil did their ruin seek , For God does hate such bloody things As Massacres , etc See how the Stratagems of Room , Have wrought these bloody Actors doom , That have been fifteen years about , What some few years have quite brought out , And Stafford he hath led the Van , A Traitorous wretch and wicked man , 'Tis sure God hates such bloody things As Massacres , etc This is a Tenet of our Faith No other Church in Europe hath , Never to rest till we have done The work the Devil sets us on , Yet though in Plots our lives we spend , They'l come to nothing in the End For God does hate such bloody things As Massacres , etc Though all the Wits of France and Spain More Plots contrive , 'twill be in vain , And let his holiness the Pope , On whom we Papists fix our hope , Spend all his days in such designs , The Heavens will still find Countermines And blast such wicked bloody things As Massacres , etc , The Protestants we plainly see , Protections have of high degree , That none can do them any wrong Who in their faith are firm & strong , But idle worshippers do fallen By hellish Plots , in deadly thrall . For God does blast such bloody things As Massacres , etc Then let us all renounce and fly From this our strange Idolatry , That our designs may prosperous be Else 'tis in vain we plainly see , For who with heaven does not advice In vain are their conspiracies . For God does hate such bloody things As Massacres , etc But we have stubborn hearts and do Resolve against what's just & true , Since Popes can Absolution give For our misdeeds we do believe This makes us all less care to take Though oft it makes the Actors quake , For God does hate such bloody things As massacres , etc 'Tis strange to think what Friends we had In England where our hearts now sad , Were once with joy completely fill'd , To think what blood would there be spill'd , And in a moment we were lost , Our Plots discover'd , all things crossed , For God does hate such bloody things As Massacres , and killing Kings .
