Abstract
An outbreak of orf virus infection in dairy goats in Korea was investigated. Suspected samples of
the skin and lip of affected goats were sent to the laboratory for more exact diagnosis. Orf virus
was detected by electron microscopy and viral DNA was identified by PCR. To reveal the genetic
characteristics of the Korean strain (ORF/09/Korea), the sequences of the major envelope protein
(B2L) and orf virus interferon resistance (VIR) genes were determined and then compared with
published reference sequences. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the ORF/09/Korea strain was
closest to the isolates (Taiping) from Taiwan. This is believed to be the first report on the molecular
characterization of orf virus in Korea.

Background
Contagious ecthyma (contagious pustular dermatitis; orf)
is a common epitheliotrophic viral disease of sheep,
goats, and wild ruminants and is characterized by the formation of papules, nodules, or vesicles that progress into
thick crusts or heavy scabs on the lips, gingiva, and
tongue. Orf virus is an oval, enveloped virus containing
dsDNA genome within the genus Parapoxvirus, family Poxviridae [1]. The genus also includes pseudocowpox virus
(PCPV) and bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) in cattle and parapoxvirus of red deer in New Zealand. Zoonotic
infection with orf virus is characterized by nodular and
papillomatous lesions mainly on the hands, face, and
mouth [2,3].
To reveal the genetic variation and characterization of
parapoxvirus, the major virus envelope protein B2L and

virus interferon resistance (VIR) genes have been used
recently [4-8]. Orf virus infection has been diagnosed
occasionally in Korea since the outbreak of orf was
reported clinically in the 1990s. Although a few studies
have been conducted, molecular epidemiology based on
gene sequences of orf virus has not been performed
because the population of sheep and goats is low in Korea.
In the present study, orf virus infection in dairy goats was
identified by clinical diagnosis and PCR. The complete
B2L and VIR genes were sequenced, and their phylogenetic trees were constructed.

Case presentation
In April 2009, an exanthematic outbreak occurred in a
farm with 400 dairy goats in the Chungbuk province. Sixty
dairy goats presented with wart-like lesions on the lips,
tongue, and around the anus (Fig. 1A and 1B). The clinical

diagnosis was contagious ecthyma. Morbidity was 15%
(60/400), and goats of all the ages ranging from 2 weeks
to 1 month were affected. Dried scabs collected from
affected goats were stored in a -70°C freezer until the samples were used for further study.

Typical clinical cases of orf virus infection in diary
goats (A, B), histopathological findings (C) showing
intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies
(arrows) in the keratinocytes indicated virus-induced
lesions (HE, bar = 35 m) and electron micrograph of
the orf virus particle (D) showing typical oval-shaped
morphology (bar = 100 nm).

The tissue samples were either fixed in 10% buffered formalin for histological examination, or were homogenized
mechanically in PBS in a tube using a pellet pestle device.
The homogenates were centrifuged at 3000 g for 5 min,
and the supernatant was collected and negatively stained
with 2% phosphotungstic acid for electron-microscopic
examination of orf virus.
A PCR with OVS and OVA primers was performed as
described previously [9]. In brief, the sequences of OVS
and OVA primers are 5'-AGGCGGTGGAATGGAAAGA-3'
and 5'-CCAGCAGGTATGCCAGGATG-3', respectively.
The total viral DNA was extracted from scab samples using
QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. The amplication
were performed in a GeneAmp PCR System 2700
(Applied Biosystems) using the following conditions: a
preliminary heating for 5 min at 94°C; 10 cycles of 30 s at
94°C, 45 s at 55°C, and 1 min at 72°C; 20cycles of 30 s
at 94°C, 45 s at 57°C, and 1 min at 72°C; and the final
elongation of 5 min at 72°C. For phylogenetic analysis, a
PCR was also performed using previously described primers [4,5]. The amplified gene was purified using an agarose
gel DNA extraction kit (INtRON, Seongnam, Korea) and
further cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Automated nucleotide sequencing of the VP60 gene insert
was performed using an ABI 3130XL genetic analyzer with
the BigDye® Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The nucleotides at all positions were confirmed by three or more independent
sequencing reactions in both directions. The published
sequences of parapoxviruses were retrieved from GenBank
for phylogenetic analyses (Table 1).
The B2L and VIR gene sequences of the orf virus, Korean
strain were aligned with those of parapoxvirus sequences
obtained from GenBank using Bioedit software (Ibis Biosciences, Carlsbad, CA, USA). A phylogenetic analysis was
conducted using the Bioedit software and Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) 3.1 software, with
bootstrap values calculated from 1000 replicates [10]. The
phylogenetic algorithm used for the building of the tree
was the neighbor-joining method.
All clinical samples collected from the orf outbreak were
positive using the previously described PCR method. The
amplified PCR products were separated by electrophoresis
and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide (EtBr).

The size of amplified PCR product was 708 bp (data not
shown). Keratinocytes in the stratum spinosum showed
vacuolation and ballooning degeneration. Intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies were found characteristically in keratinocytes (Fig 1C). Negatively stained orf
virus particles were examined by electron microscopy,
which revealed the oval-shaped morphology of Parapoxvi-

rus. The size of the observed virus particles was approximately 150-200 nm (Fig. 1D).
Additional PCR reactions were performed to obtain the
full-length B2L and partial VIR genes. The amplified PCR
products were 1206 bp for the full-length B2L gene and
552 bp for the partial VIR gene. The purified DNA was

sequenced for comparative analysis. The sequence comparison of the ORF/09/Korea strain demonstrated a high
degree of identity among our Korean strain and other orf
virus strains. In phylogenetic analysis based on the complete B2L gene, the ORF/09/Korea strain was closer to the
Taiping isolate (EU327506) from Taiwan (Fig. 2A). The
ORF/09/Korea strain and Taiping isolate showed 99.82%
and 99.48% similarity at the nucleotide and amino acid
levels, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences of
the complete B2L gene of the ORF/09/Korea strain and
the other strains were aligned using Bioedit software.
Unique amino acid substitutions were found at two positions (A/R250 D, I275 M).

Authors' contributions

In phylogenetic analysis based on the partial VIR gene, the
ORF/09/Korea strain also was closer to the Taiping isolate
(EU327508) from Taiwan (Fig. 2B). The ORF/09/Korea
strain and Taiping isolate showed 97.8% and 97.6% similarity at the nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively.
The deduced amino acid sequences of the partial VIR gene
of the ORF/09/Korea strain and the other strains were
aligned, and unique amino acid substitutions were found
at two positions (N/D250 E, F275 S).

Conclusion
Orf infection is endemic in Korea, and no vaccination has
been implemented to control this disease. An increase in
the dairy goat population in Korea has been observed over
the past several years. Clinical diagnosis and electron
microscopy have been used routinely to identify orf
viruses in Korea. Recently, PCR methods have been used
to detect the viruses [11,12]. The dairy goat is not a native
species in Korea and has been imported from abroad. Several causes of orf outbreaks exist, and the phylogenetic
analysis may indicate a hypothetical origin of the viral
strains involved.

JKO*, YHJ, and OSL participated in the planning of the
project. KKL and HRK performed the PCR and phylogenetic analysis. ISR and KHL collected the samples and performed electron microscopy and histopathological
examination. All authors read and approved the final
manuscript.

Although only one case from dairy goats that showed clinical signs was used in the present study, the ORF/09/Korea
strain was closest to the isolates (Taiping) from Taiwan,
according to phylogenetic analysis based on the B2L and
VIR genes. However, it is difficult to conclude the precise
route by which the Korean orf virus strain was introduced
into Korea based on molecular analysis alone. Also, at
present, all ruminants from Taiwan have been prohibited
from importation into Korea because of the outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease in Taiwan. Therefore, more epidemiological data concerning the distribution of orf
viruses in Korea and neighboring countries are needed.
Our continuing work to characterize more isolates in
Korea and neighboring countries should prove valuable
in that regard.
