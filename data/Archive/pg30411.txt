_FROM_ the time of Shakspere downwards, wits and authors innumerable
have made themselves and the public more or less merry at the expense
of the earlier efforts of the student of a strange tongue; but it has
been reserved to our own time for a _soi disant_ instructor to
perpetrate--at his own expense--the monstrous joke of publishing a
Guide to Conversation in a language of which it is only too evident
that every word is utterly strange to him. The Teutonic sage who
evolved the ideal portrait of an elephant from his "inner
consciousness" was a commonplace, matter-of fact person compared with
the daring visionary who conjures up a complete system of language
from the same fertile but untrustworthy source. The piquancy of
Senhor Pedro Carolino's _New Guide of the Conversation in Portuguese
and English_ is enhanced by the evident _bona fides_ and careful
compilation of "the little book," or as Pedro himself gravely
expresses it, "for the care what we wrote him, and for her
typographical correction."

In short, the _New Guide of the Conversation in Portuguese and
English_ was written with serious intent, and for the purpose of
initiating Portuguese students into the mysteries of the English
language. The earlier portions of the book are divided into three
columns, the first giving the Portuguese; the second what, in the
opinion of the author, is the English equivalent; and the third the
English equivalent phonetically spelt, so that the tyro may at the
same time master our barbarous phraseology and the pronunciation
thereof. In the second part of the work the learner is supposed to
have sufficiently mastered the pronunciation of the English language,
to be left to his own devices.

A little consideration of the shaping of our author's English phrases
leads to the conclusion that the materials used have been a
Portuguese-French phrase-book and a French-English dictionary. With
these slight impedimenta has the daring Lusitanian ventured upon the
unknown deep of a strange language, and the result, to quote again
from the Preface, "May be worth the acceptation of the studious
persons, and especially of the Youth, at which we dedicate him
particularly," but will at all events contribute not a little to the
Youth's hilarity.

To begin with the vocabulary; it is perhaps hardly fair to expect a
professor of languages to trouble himself with "Degrees of Kindred,"
still, such titles as "Gossip mistress, a relation, an relation, a
guardian, an guardian, the quatergrandfather, the quater-grandmother,"
require some slight elucidation, and passing over the catalogue of
articles of dress which are denominated "Objects of Man" and "Woman
Objects," one may take exception to "crumbs" and "groceries," which
are inserted among plates and cruets as ordinary table garniture.

Among what are denominated "Eatings" we find "some wigs," "a dainty
dishes," "a mutton shoulder," "a little mine," "hog-fat," and "an
amelet": the _menu_ is scarcely appetising, especially when among
"Fishes and Shellfishes" our Portuguese Lucullus sets down the
"hedgehog," "snail," and "wolf." After this such trifles as "starch"
arranged under the heading of "Metals and Minerals," and "brick" and
"whitelead" under that of "Common Stones" fall almost flat; but one
would like to be initiated into the mysteries of "gleek," "carousal,"
and "keel," which are gravely asserted to be "Games." Among "Chivalry
Orders" one has a glimmering of what is intended by "Saint
Michaelmas" and "Very-Merit"; but under the heading of "Degrees,"
although by a slight exercise of the imagination we can picture to
ourselves "a quater master," "a general to galeries," or even a
"vessel captain," we are entirely nonplussed by "a harbinger" and "a
parapet."

Passing on to "Familiar Phrases," most of which appear to be old
friends with new faces, Senhor Carolino's literal cribs from the
French become more and more apparent, in spite of his boast in the
Preface of being "clean of gallicisms and despoiled phrases." "Apply
you at the study during that you are young" is doubtless an excellent
precept, and as he remarks further on "How do you can it to deny";
but study may be misdirected, and in the moral, no less than in the
material world, it is useful to know. "That are the dishes whom you
must be and to abstain"; while the meaning of "This girl have a
beauty edge" is scarcely clear unless it relates to the preternatural
acuteness of the fair sex in these days of board schools and woman's
rights.

Further on the conversationalist appears to get into rough company,
and we find him remarking "He laughs at my nose, he jest by me,"
gallicé "_Il me rit au nez, il se moque de moi_"; "He has me take out
my hairs," "He does me some kicks," "He has scratch the face with
hers nails," all doubtless painfully translated with the assistance
of a French-English dictionary from "_Il m'a arraché les cheveux_,"
"_Il me donne des coups-de-pied_," "_Il m'a lacere la figure de ses
ongles_." It is noticeable that our instructor as a rule endeavours
to make the possessive pronoun agree with the substantive in number
and gender in orthodox Portuguese fashion, and that like a true
grammatical patriot he insists upon the substantive having the same
gender as in his native tongue; therefore "_às unhas_" must be
rendered "hers nails" and "_vóssas civilidádes_" "yours civilities."
By this time no one will be disposed to contradict our inimitable
Pedro when he remarks "_E factéo_" giving the translation as "He has
the word for to laugh," a construction bearing a suspicious
resemblance to "_Il a le mot pour rire._" "He do the devil at four"
has no reference to an artful scheme for circumventing the Archfiend
at a stated hour, but is merely a simulacrum of the well-known gallic
idiomatic expression "_Il fait le diable à quatre._" Truly this is
excellent fooling; _Punch_ in his wildest humour, backed by the whole
colony of Leicester Square, could not produce funnier English.
"He burns one's self the brains," "He was fighted in duel," "They
fight one's selfs together," "He do want to fall," would be more
intelligible if less picturesque in their original form of "_Il se
brûle la cervelle_," "_Il s'cet battu en duel_," "_lis se battent
ensemble_," "_Il manque de tomber_." The comic vein running through
the "Familiar Phrases" is so inexhaustible that space forbids further
quotation from this portion of the book, which may be appropriately
closed with "Help to a little most the better yours terms," a
mysterious adjuration, which a reference to the original Portuguese
leads one to suppose may be a daring guess at "_Choisissez un pen
mieux vos paroles_."

In the second part, entitled "Familiar Dialogues," the fun grows fast
and furious. Let us accompany our mad wag upon "The walk." "You hear
the bird's gurgling?" he enquires, and then rapturously exclaims
"Which pleasure! which charm! The field has by me a thousand
charms"; after this, to the question "Are you hunter? Will you go to
the hunting in one day this week?" he responds "Willingly; I have not
a most pleasure in the world. There is some game on they cantons."
Proceeding from "game" to "gaming" we soon run aground upon the word
"_jeu_," which as we know does duty in French both for a game and a
pack of cards. "At what pack will you that we does play?" "To the
cards." Of course this is "_A quel Jeu voulez vous que nous
Jouions?_" "_Aux cartes_;" and further on "This time I have a great
deal pack," "_Cette fois j'ai un jeu excellent!_"

Now let us listen to our friend at his tailor's: his greeting is
perky--almost slangy. "Can you do me a coat?" he enquires, but
quickly drivels down to "What cloth will you do to?" and then to the
question "What will you to double (_doubler_) the coat?" obtains the
satisfactory answer "From something of duration. I believe to you
that." After requesting to have his garment "The rather that be
possible," he overwhelms the procrastinating man of cloth with the
stern remark "You have me done to expect too," evidently a bold
version of "_Vous m' avez fait trop attendre_," which draws forth the
natural excuse "I did can't to come rather." Passing by a number of
good things which one would like to analyse if space permitted, we
arrive at "For to ride a horse," a fine little bit of word painting
almost Carlylean in its grotesqueness. "Here is a horse who have a
 bad looks. He not sail know to march, he is pursy, he is foundered.
Don't you are ashamed to give me a jade as like? he is unshoed, he is
with nails up; it want to lead to the farrier." "Let us prick
(_piquons_) go us more fast, never I was seen a so much bad beast;
she will not nor to bring forward neither put back." "Strek him the
bridle," cries the horsedealer, "Hold him the rein sharters." "Pique
stron gly, make to marsh him." "I have pricked him enough. But
I can't to make marsh him," replies the indignant client. "Go down, I
shall make marsh," declares the dealer; upon which the incensed
equestrian rejoins "Take care that he not give you a foot kicks," and
the "coper" sardonically but somewhat incoherently concludes with
"Then he kicks for that I look? Sook here if I knew to tame hix."

After the "Familiar Dialogues" we come upon a series of letters from
celebrated personages, who would be puzzled to recognize themselves
in their new dresses; and a collection of anecdotes which may be
taken singly after dinner as a gentle promoter of digestion; the
whole being appropriately concluded with "Idiotisms and Proverbs,"
between which it must be confessed the distinction is purely
imaginary; the following are a few gems: "Its are some blu stories"
(_contes bleus_); "Nothing some money, nothing some Swiss," "He sin
in trouble water" (confusion of _pécher_ and _pêcher_). "A horse
baared don't look him the tooth," "The stone as roll not heap up not
foam," _mousse_ meaning both foam and moss, of course the wrong
meaning is essential to a good "idiotism." "To force to forge,
becomes smith" (_a force de forger on devient forgeron_). "To
craunch the marmoset" and "To fatten the foot" may terminate the
list, and are incontestably more idiotic, although scarcely so
idiomatic as "_Croquer le marmot_" and "_Graisser lapatte_."

The column in Portuguese which runs throughout the original work is
omitted, and only a sufficient number of the English extracts are
culled to enable the reader to form a just idea of the
unintentionally humorous style that an author may fall into who
attempts to follow the intricacies of "English as she is spoke" by
the aid of a French dictionary and a phrasebook.

It is to be trusted the eccentric "Guide" to which this short sketch
is intended to serve as Introduction--and, so far as may be,
elucidation--is not a fair specimen of Portuguese or Brazilian
educational literature; if such be the case the schoolmaster is
indeed "abroad," and one may justly fear that his instruction--to
quote once more the Preface--"only will be for to accustom the
Portuguese pupils, or foreign, to speak very bad any of the mentioned
idioms."

  Preface.

  [Author's]

_A CHOICE of_ familiar dialogues, _clean of gallicisms, and despoiled
phrases, it was missing yet to studious Portuguese and brazilian
Youth; and also to persons of others nations, that wish to know the
Portuguese language. We sought all we may do, to correct that want,
composing and divising the present little work in two parts. The
first includes a greatest vocabulary proper names by alphabetical
order; and the second forty three_ Dialogues _adapted to the usual
precisions of the life. For that reason we did put, with a scrupulous
exactness, a great variety own expressions to english and Portuguese
idioms; without to attach us selves (as make some others) almost at a
literal translation; translation what only will be for to accustom
the Portuguese pupils, or-foreign, to speak very bad any of the
mentioned idioms._

_We were increasing this second edition with a phraseology, in the
first part, and some familiar letters, anecdotes, idiotisms,
proverbs, and to second a coin's index._

_The_ Works _which we were confering for this labour, fond use us for
nothing; but those what were publishing to Portugal, or out, they
were almost all composed for some foreign, or for some national
little acquainted in the spirit of both languages. It was resulting
from that carelessness to rest these_ Works _fill of imperfections,
and anomalies of style; in spite of the infinite typographical faults
which some times, invert the sense of the periods. It increase not to
contain any of those_ Works _the figured pronunciation of the english
words, nor the prosodical accent in the Portuguese; indispensable
object whom wish to speak the english and Portuguese languages
correctly._

_We expect then, who the little book (for the care what we wrote him,
and for her typographical correction) that may be worth the
acceptation of the studious persons, and especially of the Youth, at
which we dedicate him particularly._

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
