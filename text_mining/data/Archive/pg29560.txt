 "A ready wit and a fluent tongue are valuable auxiliaries. But force
 of character, consciousness of power, masculine ability in grappling
 with complicated questions, and that species of eloquence, the effect
 of which arises rather from earnestness, straightforwardness, and
 elevation of sentiment, than from sparkling or elaborate rhetoric, give
 a man a position in the House of Commons which leaves him little in
 need of such other gifts as we have mentioned."--_Standard, Dec. 30._

 HARRY FURNISS's ROYAL ACADEMY.

 An Artistic Joke.


The Exhibition consisted of eighty-seven pictures, in black and white
of course, but otherwise similar in size and general appearance to
those annually seen on the walls of Burlington House. Anyone who
visited it must have seen that it was the result of many years of
labour, and not a few of the pictures possessed an artistic value
quite apart from their interest as pictorial travesties. A wish
has been very generally expressed that some permanent record, in a
portable shape, but in character consonant with the artistic purpose
of the Exhibition, should be procurable by the public at large, both
those who saw and those who did not see the originals at the
Gainsborough Gallery and elsewhere.

To meet this wish an #ALBUM#, containing Reproductions of these
#EIGHTY-SEVEN PICTURES#, with which will be included the contents of
#THE ILLUSTRATED CATALOGUE#, has been prepared and largely subscribed
for. The issue of these Albums, however, which will be the only
reproductions of the Exhibition, is strictly limited to #ONE THOUSAND
COPIES#, each of which will be signed by the Artist.

It may be mentioned that the whole of this undertaking, from its
conception to the present time, has been in Mr. Furniss's own hands.
This has enabled Mr. Furniss scrupulously to maintain the artistic
character of the whole enterprise. In the preparation of this Album he
has spared no time or expense in trying reproductions by the different
processes at home and abroad, similar to those used in the Album of
the Royal Academy Pictures of 1886, and the annual reproductions of
the French Salon. Not, however, being satisfied with any of these
cheaper methods, he has, regardless of the great cost, adopted the
finest method of photogravure--viz., the Photo Intaglio process of A.
and C. Dawson, No. 3, Farringdon Street, and Hogarth Works, Chiswick,
the reproductions being made under his own supervision. Each plate is
hand-printed, and will in every way surpass, for artistic quality,
anything of the kind ever published.

As PHOTOGRAVURE is the best and most faithful, as well as the most
expensive method, this Album is certain to be valuable, and a worthy
and complete memorial of the "Artistic Joke"; whilst the price charged
will be only _£3 3s._, the same as fixed, originally, when the
adoption of the cheaper process was contemplated.

The size of the Album is Imperial Quarto (11 by 15 inches); the
plates range, on an average, from 4 × 6 to 7½ × 9 inches. The
whole is handsomely and tastefully bound in cloth and gilt edged.

AFTER THE THOUSAND VERITABLE _Édition de Luxe_ WERE PRINTED, THE
PLATES WERE DESTROYED.

_#The whole Edition is rapidly being exhausted and the price will be
raised to FIVE Guineas in a few days#_.

_Orders should be forwarded to_ THE TYPOGRAPHIC-ETCHING CO.,
_No. 3, Farringdon Street_.

"The genius of Leech has never been seen to greater advantage than in
this gallery."--_Morning Post._

"We doubt whether in the whole range of the literary or pictorial art
of the period, the earlier portion of the Victorian era has been
elsewhere so vigorously, so truthfully, as well as so humorously
portrayed as in JOHN LEECH'S inimitable pictures. The series has an
importance beyond the amusement of the moment--it serves both to
commemorate the genius of the artist and the character of the
age."--_Country Gentleman._

"There can be no better book for a drawing-room table, to suggest
subjects of talk. The arts of engraving have made rapid progress since
these pictures first appeared, but it would be hard to surpass the
pregnant humour of the more famous of the political cartoons. They put
the points on all the critical periods of our Parliamentary history,
and indicate in effective outline the action of political
celebrities."--_Times._

"It is surprising to find how complete a history of the times they
present in vivid form, at least in its most salient features; and a
history which is not confined to political events, but which catches
and stereotypes many of the evanescent phases of popular fashion and
opinion, which could hardly be preserved in any other
way."--_Guardian._

"Mr. Leslie has a keen sense of the picturesque, while a genuine
enthusiasm for the beauties of scenery to be found in the course of a
leisurely boat-trip from Putney to Oxford, gives life and even force
to what he says.... 'Our River' is not an exhaustive work, but it
should be read by all persons who are in any way interested in the
subject."--_Times._

"The diction moves in a sort of endless ripple, now telling of
water-weeds and bank-flowers and birds, now lingering pleasantly
over some of the traditions and old-world lore of which the Thames
furnishes such a goodly quantity."--_Graphic._

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
