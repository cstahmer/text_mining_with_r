                     THE NEW PUN BOOK

           COLLECTED, EDITED AND ARRANGED FROM
             THE NOTES OF TWO LEARNED PUNDITS


    Who thought they never saw the Punjab delighted in
   all pungencies of speech. Scholarly men who rejoice
    in punctiliousness in their language, contrive to
     improve its flavor and precision by exercise in
        these unexpected juxtapositions. Thus, as
         with our Pundit's famous countryman Mr.
           Jaberjee, though they use the purest
           language, they can instantly express
            every shade of thought with grace
            and completeness without resorting
               to slang:--that ready cloak
               wherewith puny minds strive
                 to cover their vulgarity
                   and lack of culture.

"Let me see," said the minister, who was filling out the marriage
certificate and had forgotten the date, "this is the fifth, is it
not?"

"No, sir!" said the bride, with some indignation, "this is only
my third!"

       *       *       *       *       *


She--I had a $5 bill in this dictionary yesterday and I can't

       *       *       *       *       *


"Why do you call that colored man a blackmailer."

"Because he is employed at the post-office. And that ain't the
worst of it."

"No?"

"No, sir; his wife takes hush money."

"You don't say so!"

"I do. She's a child nurse."

       *       *       *       *       *


    The street car lurched, she fell ker-flump!
    But got up with a happy smile,
    And to the young man said: "Please, sir,
    How many laps are to the mile?"

       *       *       *       *       *


I hear they are trying to close up the gambling establishments in
New York. Why didn't they close up Adam? He was the first
gambler. Didn't he start the races?

       *       *       *       *       *

"This is our latest novelty," said the manufacturer, proudly.
"Good work, isn't it?"

"Not bad," replied the visitor, "but you can't hold a candle to
the goods we make."

"Oh! are you in this line, too?"

"No. We make gunpowder."

       *       *       *       *       *

"An Irishman comes to this country, remains here ten years, and
goes back to Ireland and dies. What is he?"

"Why, an Irishman, of course."

"No, you're wrong; he is a corpse."

       *       *       *       *       *


He--Why has he put her picture in his watch?

She--Because he thinks she will love him in time.

       *       *       *       *       *


"I saw some delicious apples growing on a tree this morning. I
couldn't reach them, and asked the lady of the house if she would
let me take a step-ladder."

"Did she give it to you?"

"No; but she gave me a stare."

       *       *       *       *       *


"My sister had a fright yesterday. She had a black spider run up
her arm."

trousers."

       *       *       *       *       *

--Well, he used to crack jokes on his fingers.

New York Central."

"Nope! It was a 'fast' train."

       *       *       *       *       *


"What do you think of the statement that there are three hundred
haunted houses in New York?" asked Mr. Knickerbocker.

"Oh," replied Jones, "that only ghost to show how plentiful
spirits are here."

       *       *       *       *       *

"I see Dorkins has got all of his seven daughters married off."

"Yes, but he took advantage of his official position to effect
it."

"How was that?"

"Why, he is chairman of the board of public works and he
advertised for proposals."

       *       *       *       *       *


"Are your folks well to do?"

"No. They're hard to do."

"If you should die, what would you do with your body?"

"It doesn't do any good to scold the janitor about our cold
rooms."

"Yes, it does. I get all warmed up when I talk to him."

       *       *       *       *       *


"This liver is awful, Maud," said Mr. Newwed.

"I'm very sorry," returned the bride, "I'll tell the cook to
speak to the livery-man about it."

in it.

"I am told," said she, saucily, "that though you are a military
man, you are afraid of powder."

"To prove that the assertion is calumnious," replied he, "I have
only to do this."

Whereupon he lightly kissed her on the cheek, and his lips showed

"Is this a fire insurance office?"

"Yes, sir; can we write you some insurance?"

Saturday, and I'd like some protection."

       *       *       *       *       *


"We should never complain, whatever may befall us," said the
minister. "The moment we grow dissatisfied we become unhappy."

"Do you really think so?" she sighed.

"Yes," returned the good man; "the first woman who complained of
her Lot, was turned into a pillar of salt."

       *       *       *       *       *

provision dealer said, "Can you supply me with a yard of pork?"

"Pat," said the dealer to his assistant, "give this gentleman
three pig's feet."

"Did your sweetheart receive you warmly last night?" asked one
Pittsburg young man of another.

"How was that?"

"He fired me."

       *       *       *       *       *


"Permit me, then, to die at your feet!" he cried desperately.

She shivered.

"I see no objection to that," she answered. "All papa said was
that you mustn't hang around here."

       *       *       *       *       *


Don't doubt the veteran who tells you he was always where the

wagon.

"What's the matter here?"

"Man broke his neck."

"What story did he fall from?"

"Didn't fall--tried to see the top of the building."

       *       *       *       *       *


According to a florist's magazine "Jacks are becoming cheap."
This may be true, but we have known men who would have been
willing to pay $10 for one to put with the two already in their
hands.

SMITH--I notice that Robinson has an article in the paper this
morning.

JONES--Indeed! I didn't see it. What was it?

SMITH--His spring overcoat. He was taking it to the tailor to be
pressed and cleaned.

       *       *       *       *       *


When Lot found his wife transformed into a pillar of salt, he was
wise enough to let it go at that and not take a fresh one.

       *       *       *       *       *

"Do you think that as a rule people who attend theaters are
superstitious?"

"Do I think so? I know it. I have seen people sit for an hour
waiting for a ghost to walk."

"For that matter the actors themselves often wait longer than
that."

       *       *       *       *       *

"Darling," he answered, "you'll never find any change about me."

       *       *       *       *       *


"What's the matter here?" asked a stranger of a small boy, as he
noticed a large wedding party coming out of a church on Fifth
avenue.

"Nawthin' but the tied goin' out."

       *       *       *       *       *


    Oh, the sadness of her sadness when she's sad!
    Oh, the gladness of her gladness when she's glad!

    This life's a game of chance, they say:
      The saw's more sad than witty,
    The public gathers 'round to play,
      The trust controls the "kitty."

GEORGE--I can't understand why my girl shook me.

HAROLD--What was that you wrote to her the last time?

GEORGE--All that I said was, "My Dear Susie: The dog I promised
you has just died. Hoping these few lines will find you the same.
Yours, George."

    Now comes the question which will make
      This life a bitter cup....
    How many hoopskirts will it take
      To fill a trolley car up?

"Speaking of accommodating hotel clerks," remarked a Portland
commercial traveller, "the best I ever saw was in a town near
Bangor. Just before I retired I heard a scampering under the bed
and looked under, expecting to see a burglar. Instead I saw a
couple of large rats just escaping into their hole. I dressed and
went down to the office and put in a big kick. The clerk was as
serene as a summer's breeze.

"'I'll fix that, all right, sir,' he said. 'Front! Take a cat to
23 at once.'"

A recent school examination in England elicited the following
definitions:

"Noah's wife," wrote one boy, "was called Joan of Arc." "Water,"
wrote another, "is composed of two gases, oxygen and cambrigen."
"Lava," replied a third youth, "is what the barber puts on your
face." "A blizzard," insisted another child, "is the inside of a
fowl."

       *       *       *       *       *


"Why don't you demand $50,000 instead of $5,000?" said the
lawyer.

"Oh, because," explained the lady of the breach of promise suit.
"Then he might change his mind and want to marry me."

       *       *       *       *       *


"I'll admit," said Mrs. Hylo, "there are some things I don't
know"----

"That's no lie," interrupted her husband.

"But," continued the alleged better half of the combination,
"that man doesn't live who can tell me what they are."

       *       *       *       *       *


"Friend of mine to-day," said Mr. Kidder, "was talking of coming
here to board."

"I hope," remarked Mrs. Starvem, "you were pleased to recommend
our table and"----

"Sure! Told him it was just the thing for him. He's a pugilist
and wants to increase his reach."

An English motorist is quoted as saying that he classed
pedestrians as the quick and the dead: those who got out of the
way and those who didn't.

       *       *       *       *       *


"Yes, dear," said the petted young wife, examining her Christmas
gift, "these diamond earrings are pretty, but the stones are
awfully small."

"Of course, my dear," replied the diplomat husband, "but if they
were any larger they'd be all out of proportion to the size of
your ears."

Two Irish farmers who had not seen each other for a long time met
at a fair. They had a lot of things to tell each other. "Shure,
it's married I am," said Murphy. "You don't tell me so," said
Moran. "Faix, yes," said Murphy, "an' I've got a fine healthy
bhoy which the neighbors say is the very picture of me." Moran
looked for a moment at Murphy, who was not, to say the least,
remarkable for his good looks, and then said, "Och, well, what's
the harum so long as the child's healthy?"

       *       *       *       *       *


A bashful young couple, who were evidently very much in love,
entered a crowded street car in Boston the other day. "Do you
suppose we can squeeze in here?" he asked, looking doubtfully at
her blushing face.

"Don't you think, dear, we had better wait until we get home?"
was the low, embarrassed, reply.

       *       *       *       *       *


"When the old man is shaking down the furnace, carrying out the
ashes, feeding the cat and six kittens, and making the beds,"
remarked the observer of events and things, "of course he is too
busy to hear his daughter in the parlor, singing: 'Everybody
Works but Father.'"

       *       *       *       *       *


"I assured her I could support her in the style she was
accustomed to."

"Well?"

"She said she was looking for something better than that."

       *       *       *       *       *


"Do you believe in transmigration of souls?"

"Well," answered the man who never admits that he doesn't know
everything, "I wouldn't recommend it as a regular practice."

       *       *       *       *       *


"After all, you know," said Mr. Oldbeau, "a man is only as old as
he feels"----

"Yes," said Miss Pepprey, "but some old men make the mistake of
thinking they are as young as they think they feel."

       *       *       *       *       *


At a West End hotel one of the party asked:

"Have you got any celery, waiter?"

"No, sir," was the significant answer; "I relies on me tips."

       *       *       *       *       *


YEAST--Did you ever try to dye eggs?

CRIMSONBEAK--No, I never did; but I've tried 'em after they were
dead.

       *       *       *       *       *


    A dude from St. Louis named Crute
    Had a habit of saying, "Oh, shoot!"
      He said it one day
      To a man in Ouray,
    And that was the finish of Crute.

       *       *       *       *       *


"How is your house heated?"

"By hot air."

"Hot air?"

"Yes--the landlord's."

       *       *       *       *       *


"I want to get a head of cabbage," said the man who had been sent
to market.

"Large or small head?" asked the grocer.

"Oh, about 7 1-4," said the man, absent-mindedly.

       *       *       *       *       *


"I'll pass the butter," said he, while trying to pass the
browsing goat.

"I'll butt the passer," said the goat, as he helped him over the
fence.

       *       *       *       *       *


"Yes, he's got a flying-machine ready for a trial now and he's
trying hard not to be proud?"

"Why shouldn't he be proud?"

"Well, pride goes before a fall, you know."

       *       *       *       *       *


"He has none of the finer sensibilities, nothing to distinguish
him from the common herd."

"No?"

"No, sir. I've heard him confess, out of his own mouth, that all
autos smell alike to him."--_Puck._

       *       *       *       *       *


"Why did you insist on only $99,000 a year as your salary?"

"Because," answered the high financier, "as soon as people hear a
hundred thousand mentioned they get suspicious. It is better to
keep the figure marked down a little."

       *       *       *       *       *


Tom--I kissed her when she wasn't looking.

Clara--What did she do?

Tom--Kept her eyes closed the rest of the evening.

       *       *       *       *       *


Jenks--Why on earth did you laugh so heartily at that ancient
jest of Borem's?

Wise--In self-defense.

Jenks--in self-defence?

Wise--Yes; if I hadn't laughed so he would have repeated the
thing, thinking I hadn't seen the point.

       *       *       *       *       *


There is as much strength in an egg as in a pound of meat.

Gotabug--I should say so. I've smelt eggs that had more strength
than a hundred pounds of beef.

    A sporty young fellow named Phipps
    Last night went to view the eclipse.
      The moon looked so queer.
      He set up a cheer,
    The truth was he'd been taking nips.

"For mercy sake, don't put me near old Billions!" said Mrs.
Lookyoung to her friend.

"Why not?" said the other. "He's awfully interesting."

"I know it," said Mrs. Lookyoung, "but I never sit next to him at
dinner but that he blurts out something like, 'You remember back
in the old pioneer days!'"

    Mary had a little waist
      Where waists were meant to grow,

"This is an interesting clock, Miss," said the salesman, "you
really should have one, especially if you're bothered with
tiresome callers."

"It's merely a cuckoo clock, isn't it?" asked Miss May Pechis.

"Yes, but beginning at 10 P.M., instead of saying 'cuck-koo'
every quarter hour it yells: 'Go home! Go home!'"

       *       *       *       *       *


Mike--Yus, poor Sullivan is dead. He hadn't got an enemy in the
world.

Pat--What did he die of?

Mike--Oh; he wur killed in a foight.

"You shouldn't drink your whiskey without water."

"Why not?"

"You'll ruin the coat of your stomach."

"Oh, well-it's an old coat, anyhow."

"Why do they make those Oriental pipes with bowls as big as water
pitchers?" asked the inquisitive girl.

"Those," answered the wise woman, "are for men who have promised
that they will confine their smoking to one pipe after each
meal."

The detective at the boarding house table having satisfied
himself that nobody had observed him, folded up his magnifying
glass and put it back in his pocket.

"Yes," he said to himself, "they've got the same girl they had
when I was here two years ago. I recognize her thumb print in the
butter."

"Pa, what branches did you take when you went to school?"

"I never went to high school, son, but when I attended the little
log school-house they used mostly hickory and beech and willow."

"Did you ever consider the case of the boy who stood on the
burning deck?"

"Not particularly. Why?"

"Well, the game was poker and the hand had been dealt from the
burning deck was a corker; so, as he didn't want to lose any
chances, he--but you see?"

"I don't know as I do."

"Why, he stood pat."

The Governess--What happened when the man killed the goose that
laid the golden egg, Margie?

Little Margie--Why, I guess his goose was cooked.

"Our new Congressman has made himself very popular."

"What has he done?"

"Introduced a bill declaring it a penal offence for a man to ask
for a haircut or shampoo on Saturday afternoon."

       *       *       *       *       *


"In my business," said the stock broker, "It is impossible to
succeed without pluck."

"Huh!" snorted the man who had been up against it, "you mean
'plucking,' don't you?"

       *       *       *       *       *


Servant--The plumber says this check should be $5 more.

Castleton--But it's the amount asked for.

"Yes, sir. But you've kept him waitin' for nearly an
hour."--_Life._

       *       *       *       *       *


Tom--What's that? A two-dollar bill! You told me this morning
that you were broke.

Jack--Well, I want you to understand that Japan isn't the only
one that can borrow money.

       *       *       *       *       *


"Yes, indeed, he's the homeliest man in public life to-day.
Haven't you ever seen him?"

"No, but I've seen caricatures of him."

"Oh, they flatter him. You should see him."

  1--Guests are requested not to speak to the dumb waiter.

  2--Guests wishing to get up without being called can have
     self-raising flour for supper.

  3--The hotel is supported by a beautiful cemetery; hearses to
     hire, 25c. a day.

  4--Guests wishing to do a little driving will find a hammer and
     nails in the closet.

  5--If the room gets too warm, open the window and see the fire
     escape.

  6--If you're fond of athletics and like good jumping, lift the
     mattress and see the bed spring.

  7--If your lamp goes out, take a feather out of the pillow; that's
     light enough for any room.

  8--Any one troubled with nightmare will find a halter on the
     bed-post.

  9--Don't worry about paying your bill; the house is supported by
     the foundation.

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
