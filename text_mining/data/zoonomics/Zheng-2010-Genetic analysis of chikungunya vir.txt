Abstract
Background: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has caused large outbreaks worldwide in recent years, especially on the
islands of the Indian Ocean and India. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti), which are widespread
in China, with an especially high population density in southern China. Analyses of full-length viral sequences
revealed the acquisition of a single adaptive mutation providing a selective advantage for the transmission of
CHIKV by this species. No outbreaks due to the local transmission of CHIKV have been reported in China, and no
cases of importation were detected on mainland China before 2008. We followed the spread of imported CHIKV in
southern China and analyzed the genetic character of the detected viruses to evaluate their potential for evolution.
Results: The importation of CHIKV to mainland China was first detected in 2008. The genomic sequences of four
of the imported viruses were identified, and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the sequences were clustered
in the Indian Ocean group; however, seven amino acid changes were detected in the nonstructural protein-coding
region, and five amino acid changes were noted in the structural protein-coding regions. In particular, a novel
substitution in E2 was detected (K252Q), which may impact the neurovirulence of CHIKV. The adaptive mutation
A226V in E1 was observed in two imported cases of chikungunya disease.
Conclusions: Laboratory-confirmed CHIKV infections among travelers visiting China in 2008 were presented, new
mutations in the viral nucleic acids and proteins may represent adaptive mutations for human or mosquito hosts.

Background
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted
alphavirus belonging to the family Togaviridae, with an
envelope and single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome. The genome, which is 11 to 12 kb in length, is
organized with nonstructural proteins (nsP1-4) at the
5’-end and structural proteins (Capsid-E3-E2-6k-E1) at
the 3’-end [1]. CHIKV is responsible for an acute
infection of abrupt onset, characterized by a high fever,
arthralgia, myalgia, headache, and rash [2]. The virus is
transmitted mainly from human to human by the bite
of the Aedes mosquito, primarily Aedes aegypti.
A large outbreak of chikungunya disease (CHIK)
occurred in India in 2005-06, with more than 1 million

cases reported [3]. It is believed that the outbreak originated in Kenya during 2004, was followed by outbreaks on islands in the southwestern Indian Ocean in
early 2005 [4]. Outbreaks continued to be reported in
many other countries, including Gabon, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka, in 2007, and Singapore and Sri Lanka in 2008. Most of these outbreaks
were attributed to variants of the central/east African
genotype of CHIKV [5], but in Malaysia, co-circulating
genotypes of CHIKV (Asian and central/east African)
were reported [6,7].
RNA viruses are usually highly genetically diverse, and
their genomes contain signs of past and present variation and mobility. High mutation rates and quasispecies
dynamics have conferred on them significant adaptive
potential. Genetic analyses of viral genomic sequences
conducted over relatively short times during an outbreak
can be used to distinguish between different strains of a
virus. Such data are helpful in understanding the

evolutionary potential of a virus and mechanisms underlying the development of a disease outbreak; moreover,
they may be used in the development of new strategies
for viral disease prevention and control. The outbreaks
in the Indian Ocean, which were of unprecedented magnitude, were partially due to a mutation in the E1 protein of CHIKV (A226V), which helped in the adaptation
of the virus to Aedes albopictus [3,8].
Aedes albopictus is widespread in China, with an
especially high population density in southern China.
No outbreaks due to the local transmission of CHIKV
have been reported in China, and no importation of
cases was detected in mainland China before 2008.
Humans are the major source, or reservoir, of CHIKV
for mosquitoes; the mosquito transmits the disease by
biting an infected person and then biting someone
else. The introduction and spread of CHIKV outbreaks
in China is a potential threat. Therefore, it is important to strengthen the surveillance of CHIKV and prevent the localization of imported CHIKV. Here, we
report five imported cases of CHIK from Sri Lanka
and Malaysia during March, October, and December
of 2008, respectively. Whole-genome analyses of four
CHIKV were performed, and unique nucleic acid and
amino acid changes, as compared to CHIKVs isolated
during different years, from different geographical
regions, and from different clades, were detected.

IgM and IgG Detection in Serum

Sera from the patients and close contacts were tested for
the presence of IgM or IgG antibodies against dengue or
CHIKV. Dengue virus-specific antibodies were detected
using a Panbio MacELISA kit for IgM and indirect ELISA
kit for IgG according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
CHIKV-specific antibodies were detected using an indirect
immunofluorescence test (IIFT) (EUROIMMUN, Lübeck,
Germany). In brief, the samples were diluted 1:10-1:80,
and 20 μL were applied to the reaction fields of the BIOCHIPs, which were then incubated for 1 h. For the detection of IgM and IgG, rheumatic factor was pre-adsorbed
with EUROSORB reagent (EUROIMMUN). For antibody
detection, anti-human IgG or IgM antibodies labeled with
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) were used. The results
were evaluated by fluorescence microscopy; titers ≥1:10
were considered positive.
Diagnostic RT-PCR

The extraction of viral RNA from the CHIKV isolates or
human sera was achieved using a QIAamp Viral Minikit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s recommended procedures. The partial sequence
of the gene encoding E2 from CHIKV was amplified by
nested PCR using a previously described method [9]
with a Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR Kit. Products of the
expected sizes (427 and 172 bp) were obtained by outer
and inner PCR, respectively. The outer product was
sequenced using an automated ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer with the PCR primers, without further cloning. Subsequently, the obtained sequence was blasted against
GenBank to verify the amplified fragments.

Materials and methods
Patients and Clinical Specimens

Patients with a fever (up to 37.8°C) were identified from
three travel groups visiting or returning to China from
March to December in 2008. Serum samples from the
patients and 30 close contacts were collected for dengue
and CHIKV testing (Table 1). All work with potentially
infectious material was performed in a biosafety level 2
or 3 containment facility.

CHIKV Isolation

A CHIKV stock was isolated by placing 10 μL of patient
serum (SD08Pan) at a dilution of 1:10 onto a confluent
monolayer of Vero cells in a 24-well plate. The virus was

allowed to absorb for 1 h at 37°C, after which 1 mL of
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with
2% fetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics was added and
the plate was incubated at 37°C under 5% CO2. The cultures were checked daily for cytopathic effects (CPEs). At
approximately 80% CPE, the cells and supernatants were
harvested (day 5). The isolates were identified as CHIKV
by genomic sequencing via RT-PCR.
Nucleotide Sequencing and Sequence Analysis

To obtain the complete sequence of the CHIKV genome, primers were designed based on an alignment of
all of the CHIKV genomic sequences published in GenBank (available upon request). Viral RNA was obtained
directly from patient serum or a viral isolate after one
passage in Vero cells. Reverse transcription was performed with a SuperScript III cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Amplification was achieved
using a Platinum® Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity
Kit (Invitrogen). The products were purified using 1.2%
agarose gels with Qiaquick Spin Columns (Qiagen).
Sequencing reactions were run using the BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) and purified by ethanol precipitation. Sequence chromatograms were obtained on
ABI3100 automated sequence analyzers (Applied Biosystems). All amplicons were sequenced twice on each
strand. Sequences were assembled with the DNA-Star
software package and compared with ClustalW 1.83 to
previously published CHIKV sequences in GenBank.
Neighbor-joining trees were constructed using MEGA
version 4.0 [10]. Evolutionary distances were computed
using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method [11]
and are given as the number of base substitutions per
site. All positions containing gaps and missing data were
eliminated from the dataset. There were a total of 11594
positions in the final dataset.

Results
Case discovery and sample collection

On March 4, 2008, a group of 20 Chinese men returned
to China through Guangzhou Airport via Malaysia after

about six months in Sri Lanka. One of the men (41
years old) presented with a flu-like syndrome and a
fever of 38.2°C. On March 12th, a second man (50 years
old) developed a fever of up to 38°C with joint pain in
the knees. In October of 2008, a group of nine people
from Malaysia visited Guangdong Province through
Guangzhou Airport, one of whom (a 26-year-old man)
appeared feverish at customs. Physical examination
revealed a flu-like syndrome with a fever of 38.6°C,
hemorrhagic petechia around the body, and no joint
pain. Five days later, the father of the patient (a 63-yearold man) presented with a fever of 37.8°C and pain in
the joints of his knees and fingers. In December of
2008, an eight-person family group came to China from
Malaysia through Guangzhou Airport. A 44-year-old
male in the group was found to have a fever of 39°C
and conjunctivitis. The three patients imported from
Malaysia during October to December of 2008 had lived
in Malaysia for a long time with no recent outside travel
history or contact with infectious disease patients.
A general description of each clinical case and of the
serum samples collected from the above five patients
and 30 close contacts is given in Table 1; the cases were
classified as suspected cases of dengue or CHIKV
infection.
Laboratory tests and diagnosis

The serum samples from the suspected patients and
close contacts were tested by ELSIA, IIFT, and RT-PCR
for dengue and CHIKV. Evidence of CHIKV infection
was found in all five patients classified as a suspected
case (Table 2). The serum in case 1 (FD080008; returning from Sri Lanka) was weakly positive for dengue IgM
and IgG antibodies, suggesting a dengue viral infection;
however, cross reaction could not be excluded. Four of
the five cases appeared to be CHIKV IgM-positive. Only
one serum sample, SD08Pan, was CHIKV IgG-positive.
RT-PCR revealed that the five cases were infected with
CHIKV. Nucleotide sequence analysis in each case
amplified a 427-bp fragment, showing that the viral
strains belonged to a group of viruses identified recently
in the Indian Ocean (data not shown). Of the 30

samples from close contacts, no evidence of dengue
and/or CHIKV infection was detected.
Virus isolation

Three days after cell culture inoculation using serum
from patient 2, a CPE was observed, which was transferable following cell-free passage of the supernatant to
fresh Vero cells. RNA was extracted from the supernatant of the first passage and analyzed by RT-PCR and
nucleotide sequencing. The supernatant was found to
contain CHIKV (referred to as SD08Pan).
Genetic analysis

The nearly complete genomic sequences of four
imported CHIKVs (FD080008 and SD08Pan from Sri
Lanka and FD080178 and FD080231 from Malaysia)
were determined [GenBank: GU199350-GU199353].
The genomic sequences of FD080008, FD080178, and
FD080231 were obtained directly from the sera of
patients in the acute phase; the sequence of SD08Pan
was obtained from viral isolates in the first passage.
Using these whole-genome sequences, we sought to
detect genetic variation between our CHIKVs and
those isolated during a large outbreak in the Indian
Ocean.

Page 4 of 6

We compared an 11677-bp region from our viruses
with 22 other complete genomic sequences taken from
CHIKVs isolated during different years. Phylogenetic
analysis clearly demonstrated that the four viral
sequences belonged to the homogeneous Indian Ocean
clade (Fig. 1). Viruses FD080178 and FD080231
(imported from Malaysia) were less related to the Asian
isolates, which were recently reported to be the cause of
a reemergence of endemic CHIK in Malaysia [6].
Changes in sequence, compared to 22 published CHIKV
whole-genome sequences from GenBank, were detected
in FD080008 (8 bp), SD08Pan (12 bp), FD080178 (11
bp), and FD080231 (7 bp) (Additional file 1 and 2).
These changes produced specific amino acid changes in
FD08008 (nsP3-M394I, E2-R178H, and 6K-V31I),
SD08Pan (nsP1-Q120R, nsP2-G577R, nsP2-N632S, and
nsP3- D372N), FD080178 (nsP2-L539S, nsP4-P181S, CT8A, E2-K252Q, and E1-A306V), and FD080231 (nsP2L539S, C-T8A, and E2-K252Q) (Table 3). Notably, nsP2
(L539S), C (T8A), and E2 (K252Q) appeared in both
isolates imported from Malaysia (FD080178 and
FD080231). In addition to these changes, there were a
total of 19 silent nucleotide substitutions in the four
imported viruses (Additional file 2). E1 A226V was
observed in FD080178 and FD080231, while the other

Discussion
Although the large epidemic of CHIK across the islands
of the Indian Ocean is now in decline, outbreaks of the
Indian Ocean strains were reported in many other countries, and opportunities for the introduction of CHIKV
to China were not limited.
In this study, for the first five cases of CHIK
detected in China in 2008, the possible transmission of
the virus carried by the travelers was monitored.
Although, of the five imported cases, secondary cases
were detected among the travelers from groups I and
II at eight and five days after the onset of the first case
in the group, respectively, we believe that the infections originated in Sri Lanka and Malaysia, respectively, rather than in China, as the disease has an
incubation period of about three to twelve days [2]
and no other local close contacts were found to be
infected. For the two close contacts of the cases from
group III (from Malaysia) who presented with a mild
fever and were suspected to have a CHIKV infection,
laboratory analysis did not support the suspicion and
additional samples were not collected because the individuals left China soon after the onset of the first case
in the travel group.
The amino acid differences detected among the
imported CHIKVs might be related to their biological
or pathogenic characteristics. To examine the genetic
variation among the imported CHIKVs, a whole-genome analysis was performed based on 22 published
CHIKV sequences. To prevent viral genome mutations
caused by cell passage, we obtained our whole-genome
sequences directly from clinical serum samples
(FD080008, FD080178, and FD080231) or viral isolates
(SD08P) and passaged in Vero cells only once.

Nonstructural proteins (nsPs) are involved in viral
replication [12,13], and studies of other alphaviruses
have suggested a strong effect for point mutations or
deletions in nsP1 and nsP3 on the neurovirulence of
Sindbis virus [14]. Strain SD08Pan, which was passaged
only once in Vero cells, showed four amino acid
changes in its nsPs (nsP1-Q120R, nsP2-G577R, nsP2N632S, and nsP3- D372N); in comparison, the other
sequences identified directly from patient serum showed
only one or two amino acid changes (nsP3-M394I in
FD080008, nsP2-L539S and nsP4-P181S in FD080178,
and nsP2-L539S in FD080231). These may indicate the
evolutionary potential of the virus.
In alphaviruses, structural proteins E2 and E1 occur as
a closely associated heterodimer on the surface of the
virion, with E2 projecting outward and over E1, covering
the E1 fusion loops [15,16]. The fusion of flaviviruses
and alphaviruses with host cell membranes requires activation by proteolytic cleavage and a reduced pH as a
trigger for conformational change. When alphavirus particles are exposed to a low pH, protein packing in the
icosahedral surface lattice changes substantially [17,18].
The E1-E2 heterodimers dissociate and E1 trimerizes,
causing the E2 subunits to move away, permitting clustering of E1 to initiate fusion. Mutations around a
hydrophobic pocket could alter the threshold pH for flavivirus fusion clustering [19]. Residue 243 in E2 is likely
to be the major determinant of neurovirulence within
the structural proteins [14]; near this position, both
FD080178 and FD080231 showed a unique change (E2
K252Q) in which a strongly basic amino acid was changed to a neutral one. This might alter the fusion ability
of FD080178 and FD080231. Other changes in structural
proteins (e.g., E2-R178H and 6K-V31I in FD08008 and
C T8A and E1-A306V in FD080178) were detected;
however, the effect on viral maturation and pathogenesis
is unclear.

In conclusion, the data reported here confirm that
CHIKV was imported into China, although transmission
from the travelers’ carrying CHIKV did not occur. In
addition, the nucleic acid and amino acid changes
described here may indicate recent evolution in the ability of the virus to cause an infection. Thus, clinician
attention and public health laboratory surveillance
should be enhanced in China.
