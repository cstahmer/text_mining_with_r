And Excellent New Hymn To the Mobile , exhorting them to Loyalty The Clean contrary Way . To the Tune of 41 , Or Hey Boys up go We . LEt Us advance the Good Old Cause ; Fear not Tantivitiers , whose Threatenings are as Senseless , as Our Jealousies and Fears ; 'Tis We must perfect this Great Work , and all the Tories Slay , And make the KING a Glorious Saint , The clean contrary way . [ 2 ] It is for Liberty we Plot , And for the Public Good , By making Bishops go to Pot , And shedding Guiltless Blood ; We'l Damn the Orthodoxal Beast , And their Adherents Slay ; When these are down we shall be Blessed , The clean contrary way . [ 3 ] When We the KING have Bankrupt lain , Of Power and Crown bereft him , And all his Loyal Subject's Slave , And none but Rebels left him ; When we have quite undone the Land , By IGNORAMUS sway ; We'l settle the SUCCESSION , and The clean contrary way . [ 4 ] 'Tis to Preserve His Majesty , That We against Him rise , The Righteous Cause can never Die That's Manag'd by the Wise ; Th' ASSOCIATION's a Just Thing , And That does seem to say , Who Fights for Us , Fights for the KING The clean contrary way . [ 5 ] RELIGION still must be th' Intent , The Nations Peace and Good , The Privileges of PARLIAMENT So Rarely Understood . We'l pull the Laws and Reason down , And Teach Men to Obey Their Sovereign , and the Rights o' th' Crown The clean contrary way . [ 6 ] Our Properties we'l upward set , By Imprisonment and Plunder , And Needy Whigs Preferment get , To keep all TORIES under : We'l keep in Pension Oh --- and P ------ , To SWEAR , and to BETRAY The Interest of the KING , t' Advance The clean contrary way . [ 7 ] What though the KING be now misled By the Old Popish Crew ; He'l find our Honesty has sped ; And give us all our Endue : For We ( He knows ) do Rail and PLOT , REBELLION to Obey , And that We stand for Peace and Truth , The clean contrary way . [ 8 ] And now my Noble Countrymen , You cannot doubt my Zeal , That have so True and Loyal been To KING and Commonweal ; And if at last We chance to Hang For what We Do or Say ; Our Comfort is , to Heaven We Gang The clean contrary way .
