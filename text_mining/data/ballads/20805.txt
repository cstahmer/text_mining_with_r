THE Whipster of Woodstreet , OR , A True Account of the Barbarous and Horrid Murder committed on the Body of Mary Cox , late Servant in Woodstreet LONDON . Tune of , Grim King of the Ghosts . Licensed according to Order . A Ssist me some mournful Muse , while I a sad Story relate ; Let all that these Lines peruse , lament a poor maids hard fate ; Who Guiltless and Innocent fell , by the hands of a barbarous Dame : As fierce as a fury of Hell , her sexes eternal shame . Her husband to Bristol went , his Trade to advance at the fair : While she was on mischief bent , such mischief she can't repair : for suspicion over clouding her mind , bred a tempest within her breast : her soul like a sea with rough wind , was ruffled and robbed of rest . A Ll jealous she taxed her maid , and falsely did her accuse , With theft she did her upbraid , and shamefully did abuse : While the maid in her own defence , undaunted and boldly stood , Which made the fierce Dame commence , a Tragedy full of Blood . she caused her to be fast bound to the post of her husbands bed , where she did her body wound , and whipped her almost dead : thus did she a Confession extort , of Crimes which the Maid never knew , tormenting her in such a sort , as would make ones heart for to rue . This monster not satisfied yet , though the blood run from every part , Made and Iron read hight in a pet , resolving to give her more smart , she burned her in shoulders and thighs , and several times under her ears , she would not come near her Eyes , lest iron should be quenched with her tears . Her body was blistered and whailed , she was burned from the head to the heel , her skin was so parched that it scaled , no pain like to what she did feel : she kept in her Chamber three days , unwilling the fact should be known , And turn to her Master's dispraise , if her cruel stripes should be shown . As soon as down stairs she came , her Mistress was in the old mood , The merciless savage Dame , did thirst for her very heart's blood : she caused her two Prentices then , neck and heels the poor Creature to bind , No tigress within her Den , ever showed a more savage mind . She kicked her and spurned her about , and bid the young Lad do the same : Resolving to act her part out , thus ended the tragical game , she catched up a hammer in haste , and pierced the maids brains at a blow , for which , of the hemp she must taste , old Tyburn must have her I trow . Printed for W. Thackeray at the Angel in Duck-Lane ; J. Millet at the Angel in Little-Britain ; and Alex. Milbourn at the Stationers-Arms in Green-Arbour - Court in the Little-Old-Baily .
