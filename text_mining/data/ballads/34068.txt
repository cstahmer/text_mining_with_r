The Constant LOVER : OR , Celia's Glory expressed to the Life . A pleasant new Song ( as it's sung after the Italian manner ) and great in Request at Court , and in the City . To a pleasant new Tune of , Why are my Eyes still flow ---------- ing This may be Printed , R.P. WHy are my Eyes still flow ------------ ing ? why do's my Heart thus trembling move ? Why do I sighs when go --------- ing to see the Darling-Saint I love ? Ah! she's my Heaven , and in my Eye Love's Dei --------- ty : There is no Life like to what she can give , Nor any Death like taking my leave . Tell me no more of Glow --------- ry , to Courts Ambition I'ave resign'd ; But tell a long long sto --------- ry of Celia's Face , her Shape and Mind ; Spoke too of Raptures that wou'd Life destroy , To en --------- joy : Had I a Diadem , Sceptre and Ball , For that dear minute I'd part with 'em all . For that wou'd be a Trea --------- sure , beyond what e'er the World can give ; A joy beyond all mea --------- sure , must needs in such Endearments live : Such tender Blessing , who too much can prize ? which --------- arise Beyond the reach of mortals tell , And in themselves all pleasures excel . Tell her those Roses blow --------- ing that in her Face create a spring , Those Lilies that are grow --------- ing , at e'ery sighed fresh Raptures bring ; Which breathe into my heart Love's Gentle fire make me --------- desire The dear enjoyment that I long to gain To which I wade even in a Sea of Pain . Yet pain's to me a Plea --------- sure since 'tis for her whom I adore I'le wait till shes at lea --------- sure her's with thy Captive heart restore I'll scorn to think I suffer when such bliss such --------- happiness Aa with a Glance can banish despair , Is still at hand my drooping soul to cheer . As when the Sun by Beam --------- ing upon the frozen Earth unbinds ; Her Icy Chains she seem --------- ing dead to mankind new Life soon finds , Kill'd by the warmer Rays , she pregnant grows , And be --------- stows , Her Plenty on the long expecting Swain , To let him see his hope's were not in vain . Go bear you Winds , my sighs ---------- ing in gentle Gales to her relate ; I languish , and am die --------- ing , tell her , 'tis she must stay my Fate : Tell her , her eyes have given me a Wound , that --------- uncrown'd All happiness that the world did yield , And from the Conqueror wone the field . Love's harvest is exceed --------- ing when his soft Fires do gently move When his Kindness is a breed --------- ing in the kind hearts of those we Love : Breathe , breathe , these Fires into my Celia's breas [ tO ] To make --------- me blessed , But let the gentle flame move calmly there , Calm as the thoughts of new born Infants are . Celia's Answer to the Constant Lover . The Second Part , To the same Tune . While Strephon was bewail --------- ing , the absence of his charming fair , And thou 'twas nought avail --------- ing , the Beauteous Celia she drew near : All gay as new blown Roses are She did ap --------- pear ; And hearing from the cool Grove his moan , She in pity made this kind return . Come cease your eyes from flow --------- ing , and let not my poor beauty's move A Shepherd that's so know --------- ing in all the secret ways of Love : Ah! sighs not after me for I , No Dei --------- ty Can boast , nor give the pleasure you feign , Nor make you feel a moment of Pain . Resine not then the Glow --------- ry that blooming youth bids you embrace , For things more Transi --------- tory to dote upon a fading Face : Great things pursue and lay Raptures by Which the --------- stroy What honours building in a mighty mind , Cease then to love , to your Fame be more kind . Where merit is command --------- ing , and Constancy do's bear it's part , Alas there's no withstand --------- ing For why they storm the hardest heart . Long time I did a Siege sustain , But all in --------- vain , For like the Winter by the Spring o'erthrown , I melt dear Strephon and am thy own . If Roses they are blow --------- ing for you they're blooming in my Face , For you they there are grow --------- ing For you the Lilies all take place ; To please my Strephon all Conspire , To raise high --------- er Love's charming Power to ravish the Mind , When to my dearest I strive to be kind . My Strephon then leave sighs --------- ing to Winds no more your Passion breath ; Nor speak as if a die --------- ing be you but constant and still live ; Live in your kindest Celia's heart let there Love de --------- clare The mighty Empire you o'er her have gain'd And now a Virgins kind Heart you have chain'd .
