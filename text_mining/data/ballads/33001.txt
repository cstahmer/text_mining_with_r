WHITE-HALLS PETITION TO THE PARLIAMEN That he may enjoy his former PRIVILEDGES . I Come to seek redress of my sad reproaches , But fear I shall not pass this crowd of Hackney Coaches , The dangers passed were I but once god in the Hall : Gentlemen by year leave , by year leave to you all , I never shall pass through this vast multitude , Men very civil , women boldly rude : What Woman's than Why ? shee'l abuse the Speaker , Sir take no notice of her , shee's some brainsick Quaker : Well I'll march on , and press unto the door , If I can get it handed in , I need no more : Soldiers stand by , and let Whitehalls Conviction Be humbly showed by way of just Petition , Mean time a Member coming by : this Paper speaking fallen , Prefer it good Sir , he answers , Sir I shall , etc Most happy House , who by your first Convention Of Royal Writ did swear your true intention , Was only to do good unto this Nation By Righting all by way of Reformation , In which the Kingdom , and the King consent , Strives to confirm you the only Parliament , In those long looked for and most happy days I was the Court then only had in praise , And for the Honour of my place and stations Had in the eye of this and other Nations : Well known to all I was the place of Royalty , While true bred Subject's kept their Faith and loyalty , The Rays of Majesty did grace my meanest being , And Foreign Princes deemed me worth the seeing : More golden days were seen in Fourty one , Then ever since in your best Reformation : I joyed in it , sure his Highness will be great , And in that glory I shall be complete , But thoughts and doubts arose , and Propositions Unlike to agree with Regal dispositions : No satisfaction could be given at all , At that same moment I began to fallen , Yet harmless innocence [ e ] doubts no men Foy , Subscribes with ease , this done , Anisi vealt l'Roy : Yet for all this more Justice must be had , By every Rebel Rout obtained , you'd think them mad , None could be sat , that in my compass came , Each Tumult put me in a fear of Flame , One thing yet more his Highness thought unjust , the Militia must be settled in whom they could trust , Majestic thoughts think this too high a Play , So modestly replies , Le Roy's advosra , That's cause enough for to suspect his heart , He is not ours , he rakes ill Counsels part , Lets urge him more , if he refuse this thing , There is no reason that he should be King . Poor Prince oppressed ! Sithes , Oh God , thou art most just , Now unto man I must commit that trust That to my Crown inherent was always , Suspicious Subject's mildly to appease ; Take here the power by which I you defend , To satisfy you I no ill intend : I take your promise that you'l make me glorious , Wrest not my power to make your selves victorious : Since that great Grant , my Prince , and I his Palace Had little rest , but never any solace , Which though he loved me , left me here alone , Unto the world to utter forth my moan , And though as his Servant I have ever been , Malignancy in me could never be seen , If outwardly I seemed discontent , I still receive you as a Parliament You and your Friends I ever did respect , Now I implore you do not me neglec Nothing I teink can be objected more , Since the Protector turn'd me out of th' door : For what I did I was constrain'd by force To Quarter Soldiers and Troops of Horse , For which I humbly submit to your Honours pleasure , And shall attend you at your own best leisure , For in my power it was not to prevent , for you before showed him the President . Humbly I show that that is not the grief , I do so earnestly seek your relief , This this I crave , for if reports be true , I must be sold to Ferdinand the Jew . Sad was the news that Times so much should vary , For at the word each Room looks solitary , That I who always lodg'd Defenders of the Faith , Should be a Proselyte at the last hour of my death , Disgrace me not by such opprobrious sail , Although on Kingship was my true entail , My splended Juster is only fit for you , And for Ambassadors of me to take a view . But if of force that moneys must be rais'd , Sure there is other Houses by you to be ceas'd : The Superstitious House of Somerset I say , More honour is it , to make that first away : And many more , sold at such poor low Rates , That it might seem they cheated but the States Of half the valve for which they were sold Some were so greedy to receive their Gold , Preserve me pray you for my ancient luster , Although your Soldiers do but only Muster , And quarter in my sad decaying Rooms , If that your Honours have decreed such dooms , But gladder should I be if it would be my fate , To be preserved for the Council of our State , That they may fit there by your full consent , And keep me in repair , although they paid no Rend . The Premises taken to due consideration , Will much redound to the honour of our Nation . This is the sum of all the boon I crave , And in requital you my prayers shall have . FINIS .
