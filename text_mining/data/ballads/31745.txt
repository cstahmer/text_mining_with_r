A most sweet Song of and English Merchant born in Chichester . To and Excellent new Tune . A Rich Merchantman that was both grave and wise Did kill a man at Embden Town , through quarrels that did rise , Through quarrels that did rise , the Germane being dead ; And for that fact tO [ h ] e Merchantman , was judg'd to loose his head . A sweet thing love , it rules both heart and mind , There is no comfort in this world , to women that are kind . A Scaffold built was , within the Market place , And all the people far and near did thither flock apace : Did thither flock apace : this doleful sighed to see , Who all in Velvet black as jet , unto the place came he : A sweet , etc Bareheaded was he brought , his hands were bound before , A Cambrick Ruff about his neck , as white as milk he wore , His Stockings were of silk , as fine as fine might be , Of person and of countenance , a proper man was he ; A sweet thing , etc When he was mounted up , upon the Scaffold high , All women said great pity it was , so sweet a man should die : The Merchant's of the Town , from death to set him free , Did proffer there a thousand pound , but yet all would not be : A sweet thing , etc The Prisoner hereupon began to speak his mind : ( Quoth he ) I have deserved death in conscience I do find : Yet soar against my will , this man I kill'd ( quoth he ) As Christ does know , which of my soul , must only Saviour be . A sweet thing , etc With heart I do repent , this most unhappy deed , And for his wife and Children small , my very heart does bleed : The deed is done and passed , my hope of life is vain , And yet the loss of this my life , to them is little gain . A sweet thing , etc Unto the Widow poor , and to the babes therefore , I give a hundred pound a piece , their comforts to restore : Destring at their hands , no one request but this , They will speak well of Englishmen though I have done amiss : A sweet thing , etc This was no sooner done , but that to stint the strife , Four goodly Maids did roffer him , for love to save his li [ f ] e : This is our law ( quoth [ tO ] heigh ) we may your death r [ e ] move , So you in lieu of our good will , will grant to us your love : A sweet thing , etc Brave English-man ( quoth one ) 'tis I will beg thy life ; Nay , quoth the second it is I , so I may be thy wife : This I the third did say ; nay , quoth the fourth , 'tis I , So each one after other said , still waiting his reply ; A sweet thing is love , etc The Second Part , To the same Tune . FAir Maidens every one , I must confess and say , That each of you well worthy is , to be a Lady gay : And I unworthy far , the worst of you to have , though you have proffered willingly , my loathed life to save : A sweet thing is love , it rules both heart and mind , There is no comfort in this world , to women that are kind . Then take a thousand thanks , of me a dying man , But speak no more of love nor life , for why my life is gone : To Christ my soul I give , my body unto death : For none of you my heart can have , sith I must lose my breath : A sweet thing , etc Fair Maids lament no more , your Country Law is such , It takes but hold upon my life , my goods it cannot touch : Within one Chest I have , in gold a thousand pound , I give it equal to you all , for love that I have found : A sweet thing , etc And now dear friends farewell , sweet England now adieu , And Chichester where I was born , where first this breath I drew : And now thou man of death , unto thy Weapon stand ; O nay , another Damsel said ; sweet Headsman hold thy hand . A sweet thing , etc Now hear a Maidens plaint , brave English-man ( quoth she ) And grant me love for love again , that craves but love of thee : I woo and sue for love , that have been woo'd e'r this : Then grant me love , & therewithal , she proffered him a kiss , A sweet thing , etc I'le die within thy arms , if thou wilt die ( quoth she ) Yet live or die sweet English-man , i'le live and die with thee : But can it be ( quoth he ) that thou dost love me so : 'Tis not by long acquaintance sir , whereby true love does grow : A sweet thing , etc Then beg my life ( quoth he ) and I will be thy own : If I should seek the world for love , more love cannot be shown : The people at that word , did give a joyful cry , And said great pity it had been , so sweet a man should die ; A sweet thing , etc I go my love she said : I run , I fly for thee , And gentle headsman spare a while my Lovers head for me : Unto the Duke she went , who did her grief remove , And with and hundred Maidens more she went to fetch her love : A sweet thing , etc With music sounding sweet , the foremost of that train , The gallant Maiden like a Bride , did fetch him back again ; Yea , hand in hand they went unto the Church that day , And they were Married presently , in sumptuous rich array : A sweet thing , etc To England came he then , with this his lady Bride , A fairer woman never lay by any Merchant's side : Where I must leave them now in pleasure and delight , But of their names & dwelling place I must not here recite . A sweet thing is love , it rules both heart and mind , etc FINIS . London , Printed for F. Coals , T. Vere , and J. Wright . A most sweet Song of and English Merchant born in Chichester .
